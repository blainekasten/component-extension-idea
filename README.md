# Why is this a bad idea

> or is it?

I'm curious if this is a bad idea to create our own `Component` and have it maintain some internal functionality that extends `React.Component`.

If this isn't a bad idea, I think we can create a really cool state library that makes your application state a first class citizen of React components.

* How does React 17 async mode affect this?
* Is this a bad idea?
* Is this a great idea?
* What holes am I not seeing?
